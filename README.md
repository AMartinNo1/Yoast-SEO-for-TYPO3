# Yoast SEO for TYPO3
This plugin integrates text analysis and assessment from [YoastSEO.js](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js). Content analysis can generate interesting metrics about a text and give you an assessment which can be used to improve the text.

## Installation
You can easily install the plugin with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Just use the following command in the root of your project:  

```bash
composer require yoast-seo-for-typo3/yoast_seo
